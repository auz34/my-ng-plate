# my-ng-plate

Opinionated boiler plate for new angular based applications. Inspired by [ngbp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp), 
[Angular-Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) and [Yeoman->angular](http://yeoman.io/generators).

***

## How to use
1. Clone github project
```sh
wincmdline> git clone git://github.com/auz34/my-ng-plate
```
2. Clean github bindings to the original project
```sh
wincmdline> rmdir .\.git /s /q
``` 

3. Edit package.json and bower.json to replace my-ng-plate related lines there with ones specific to your project
4. Commit and push as initial check in into your repository

## Roadmap
1. Add option to use Gulp instead of Grunt
2. Add yeoman-like generator to automate process described above
